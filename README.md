- 👋 Hi, I’m Petri Louhenheimo!
- 👀 I’m interested in SciFi (be it books, movies, tv shows or games), walking or cycling around the hood or in the wilderness, grinding my own coffeebeans & generally just enjoying life :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Everything! What interests me most to learn at the moment is JavaScript (+ related stuff), software engineering & project working.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: if you have interesting JS project I could participate, just give me a shout!
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn for example: https://www.linkedin.com/in/louhenheimo/
